create a classifier that would be able to predict whether or not applicants would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The classifier is a neural network with the option of tuning hyperparameters to optimize how well the classifier will perform. This report will give a detailed analysis of the preprocessing of the data and how the hyperparameters were tuned along with a recommendation of another potential model for this classification problem.\n","\n","## Results\n","### Data Preprocessing\n","The features we considered for our model are:\n","1.   Application Type\n","2.   Affiliation\n","3.   Government Classification\n","4.   Use Case\n","5.   Organization\n","6.   Active Status\n","7.   Income\n","8.   Speccial Considerations\n","9.   Funding Amount Requested\n","\n","The variable that should not be included to train our model is the identification data.\n","\n","The target variable we wanted to consider for our classification of our model was whether or not the organization was successful\n","\n","### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model\n","I have performed more tests than displayed in my analysis. For my best model I used 39 total neurons, 3 total hidden layers, and a combination of relu and sigmoid activation functions at 100 epochs. I was not able to achieve the target model performance.\n","The four hyperparameters I played around with were:\n","\n","*   Amount of neurons\n","*   Amonut of hidden layers\n","*   Activation function\n","*   Number of Epochs\n","\n","\n","The values I for each hyper parameter:\n","\n","Range of neurons: 2-70, where 70 is the highest and I would decrease neurons for every next layer\n","\n","Activation Function: Input: Relu, Output:Sigmoid, Hidden Layers: Combination of Relu/Sigmoid\n","\n","Amount of hidden Layers: 1-3, with a total of 4 layers, including the output.\n","\n","Nuumber of Epochs: I used primarily 100 and 200 epochs, but 100 seemed to perform better with my set of tuned hyperparameters.\n","\n","## Summary\n","Overall, I was not able to achieve an accuracy of above 75%. There are some ways to optimize the model, most of which would be trial and error. There is a keras tuner package that would also help optimize the hyperparameters. With the labels of the data, we should be able to run a supervised ML model for this classification problem. One I would potentially recommend would be the Random Forest Classifier. It has a similar approach with the neural network in that it has multiple layers, which would be unique to a set of features and then come down to some classification.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6CCVECJyuCxd"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.6"},"colab":{"name":"Benjamin_Nguyen_Deep_Learning.ipynb","provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
